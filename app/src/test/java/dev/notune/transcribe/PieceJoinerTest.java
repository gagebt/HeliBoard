 * Whole dictation sessions, replayed against a StringBuilder standing in for the field.

 * sentence to think, and the sentence must not be cut in two. The recording is still cut
 * at the short silence, because that is what makes the words appear while he speaks; what
 * changes is that a cut is not believed to be a sentence end until the silence before the
