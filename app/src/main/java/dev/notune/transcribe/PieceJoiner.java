package dev.notune.transcribe;

/**
 * Joins the pieces of one dictation session into the field, one append at a time.
 *
 * <p>Pure, like {@link TextFitter}: no {@code android.*} import, so a whole session
 * can be replayed in a unit test with a {@link StringBuilder} standing in for the
 * field.
 *
 * <p>Why it exists. The recording is cut into pieces at silences so that the text can
 * appear while the owner is still speaking. Each piece is transcribed on its own, so
 * the model ends every piece with a full stop and capitalises the first word of the
 * next one. A pause taken to think would therefore cut a sentence in two:
 * "I was thinking" + "that we should go" becomes "I was thinking. That we should go."
 *
 * <p>The cure is to wait before believing the full stop. A piece is committed without
 * its terminal mark; the mark is held. The silence before the next piece then decides:
 * a short one was a hesitation and the mark is dropped, so the next piece continues the
 * sentence; a long one was a real sentence end and the mark is emitted first. At the
 * end of the session the last held mark is emitted as the model produced it.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here ever revises text that is already in the field. Emitting a held mark
 * is an append at the cursor, exactly where the mark would have gone. How the next
 * piece joins what is now in front of the cursor is not a second mechanism: it is the
 * same question {@link TextFitter} already answers, so it is asked of {@link TextFitter}
 * with the text the field will hold at that moment.
